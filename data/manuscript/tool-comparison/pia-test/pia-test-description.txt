PIA

To run PIA, Knime was installed and the package for PIA was installed
(as instructed in the very nice Tutorial). The knime workflow
01-PIA_first_analysis.knwf (from tutorial) was loaded and additional
required packages were installed. As suggested in this workflow, the
Input-File node was connected to the URI-to-port node to skip X!Tandem
searches. The artifical data file GroupingTest.idXML was used as input
and PIA was run once with the Occam's Razor setting and once with the
Report All setting. The resulting tables were saved as
pia-results-occam.csv and pia-results-reportall.csv.

Occam + Groups / Anti-Occam + Groups
-> not implemented
Occam + Subgroup
-> Case 12 failed, randomly chooses a protein to remove (2 or 3)
Anti-Occam + Subgroup (Report All)
-> Case 3 failed, 2 groups instead of one (cannot detect the subset)
-> Case 10 failed, P2+3 are not grouped (cannot detect the subset)

The third method (Spectrum) produces weird results (order of PSMs relevant)
... maybe it needs some value that is not properly set in the test data
(i.e. SpectrumID, now equal for all - which is not normal). It should
be noted that this advanced 3rd grouping method is there, even if not
part of this test.
