MPA

To run the test-cases on MPA, an SQL-file with the test data was created (grouping_test_modified.sql).
A new SQL database was created (metaprot_groupingtest) and the SQL file was used to add the data to this
database: "mysql -u $USERNAME -p metaprot_groupingtest < grouping_test_modified.sql". The MPA config file was set
to use the new database (metaprot_groupingtest) and MPA GUI was started. The data is found in an Project and Experiment
with the name GroupingTest (for both). The "Fetch Results" button in this experiment will load the proteins.
The "Process Results" button creates the protein grouping. To create protein groups the option "shared peptide" was used,
to create subgroups the option "shared peptide set" was used. The option Export->Export CSV->Export Metaproteins was used
to export the results found in mpa-results-groups.csv and mpa-results-subgroups.csv.

Since this is our tool, we do not take extra steps to verify
that the grouping actually fails - a look at the code tells us this
is the case. compomics/metaproteomeanalyzer
